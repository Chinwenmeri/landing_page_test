This file contains the plain html css and javascript for a landing page test design that I have taken. 

The design was gotten from the drawkit mental health page. 

A reference image was added to the file to show what I have tried to attempt. 

I also intend to replicate the projects using TailwindCSS. 

it consists of a somewhat easy design that has an image and some style portions

I have tried to replicate to the best of my ability. 

I will add the detail applied in this readme file
